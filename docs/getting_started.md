# Getting started

There are a few steps to start your application:

- Install Fiorite CLI:

```shell script
$ npm i -g @fiorite/cli
```

- Setup packages or create a new project:

    - If you like to create a new project, run `io new [name]`. It will create a new project with Git repository.
    
    ```shell script
    $ io new my-api
    ``` 

    - If you already have a project and want just integrate your code, run `io init [name]`.
    
    ```shell script
    $ io init my-api
    ```  

- Start your application

```
$ io start
```
