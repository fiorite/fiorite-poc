# HTTP

Package provides interfaces to serve or request resources through HTTP protocol.   

### TODO

- Move websockets to `@fiorite/ws` package.
- Fix file imports: `@fiorite/http` should expose only http interfaces.
- `@fiorite/http/router` should provide routing functionality.
- `@fiorite/http/client` only http client
- `@fiorite/http/server` only http server
- `@fiorite/http/api` only controllers, endpoints, middlewares,
